## What is AliaSQL?

![AliaSQL](images/AliaSQL-200x200.png)

AliaSQL is a command line tool for database deployments. It is a drop in replacement for [Tarantino](https://github.com/HeadspringLabs/Tarantino) with some additional features.

## How do I get started?

Check out the [getting started guide](https://github.com/ClearMeasure/AliaSQL/wiki/Getting-started).

Check out the [wiki for some background information](https://github.com/ClearMeasure/AliaSQL/wiki/).

Read the blog posts [here](http://sharpcoders.org/post/Introducing-AliaSQL) and [here](http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/aliasql-the-new-name-in-automated-database-change-management/).

There is also a C# runner as of version 1.4. Read about it here https://github.com/ClearMeasure/AliaSQL/wiki/C%23-runner 

## What is this repository?

This repository is a very quick and dirty port to .net 6.0 including only the parts of Tarantino needed to the get project up and running.

Web components have been removed because I don't use them. :grin:

## Wishlist

- Replace Tarantino with something more modern
- Replace StructureMap with a more modern DI container
- Rewrite and modernize the core code
